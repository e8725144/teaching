# Hi there üëã Welcome to my teaching materials!

I'm working on Information Retrieval at the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), mainly focusing on the award-wining master-level Advanced Information Retrieval course. I try to create engaging, fun, and informative lectures and exercises &ndash; both in-person and online!

## Our Time-Optimized Content Creation Workflow for Remote Teaching

Our workflow creates an engaging remote learning experience for a university course, while minimizing the post-production time of the educators. We make use of ubiquitous and commonly free services and platforms, so that our workflow is inclusive for all educators and provides polished experiences for students. Our learning materials provide for each lecture: 1) a recorded video, uploaded on YouTube, with exact slide timestamp indices, which enables an enhanced navigation UI; and 2) a high-quality flow-text automated transcript of the narration with proper punctuation and capitalization, improved with a student participation workflow on GitHub. We automate the transformation and post-production between raw narrated slides and our published materials with custom tools.

## Advanced Information Retrieval 2021

**üèÜ Won the Best Distance Learning Award 2021 @ TU Wien**

Information Retrieval is the science behind search technology. Certainly, the most visible instances are the large Web Search engines, the likes of Google and Bing, but information retrieval appears everywhere we have to deal with unstructured data (e.g. free text).

**A paradigm shift.** Taking off in 2019 the Information Retrieval research field began an enormous paradigm shift towards utilizing BERT-based language models in various forms to great effect with huge leaps in quality improvements for search results using large-scale training data. This course aims to showcase a slice of these advances in state-of-the-art IR research towards the next generation of search engines.
